5 years of experience in software development, both in start-ups and established consultancies. Being quality-focused led me to pursue more product and testing-oriented roles, where I can leverage my technical development experience to ensure software solutions are not only functional bu also meet user requirements. Testing allows me to stay technical while being inolved in user and business needs. Certified Product Owner (Scrum, Six Sigma) and Software Tester (ISTQB). My main technologies are:
- 𝐃𝐞𝐯 & 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: Python, SQL/NoSQL, automation, Selenium, pytest, JavaScript, Playwright, Cypress, Postman. 
- 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭: Backlog management, business analysis, prioritization, acceptance testing, user stories, product roadmap.

🌱 Outside of tech, my interest is the environment. After finishing my studies in Natural Sciences, I worked as a nature guide in the High Arctic, in Svalbard. Currently a second-year student of BA Philosophy, Politics and Economics interested in environmental policy, ecological economics and conservation.
