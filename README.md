Hi! I'm Anna and I have +5 years of experience in the tech industry.

In my role as a developer I would always be thinking about edge cases, whatifs and finding errors in existing code and bugs in production. This attention to detail and focus on quality led me to pursue more testing-oriented roles, where I can leverage my technical development experience while being more involved in user and business needs.

I have a background in natural sciences and I'm interested in environmental and animal law.
